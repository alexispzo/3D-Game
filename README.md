Description: 

This project is a 3D minimalistic game inspired by the well-known game Crossy Road. The goal is simple: the player controls a stegosaurus that must cross the road while avoiding cars to reach the next level. However, as the levels progress, the difficulty increases, with cars moving faster. If a car collides with the stegosaurus, the game restarts. Additionally, to make the game more challenging, the player must cross the road before the timer reaches 0.

Features:

- Difficulty increase: Each time the player manages to cross the road, the cars become faster.
- Collision: The program can detect any collision and restarts the game at level 1 (lowest difficulty)
- Timer: To make the game more challenging, the player must cross the road before the timer reaches 0.
- Skin: The player can select the color of the stegosaurus between the few options available inside the game. 


Technologies and Librairies Used:

- OpenGL: OpenGL is used to render 3D graphics in the game.
- GLFW: It is used to create the game window, handle user interactions\, and manage frame rendering.
- Shaders: Control the appearance of objects. 
- OBJ Loader: It reads and loads 3D models in .obj files.
- Textures: They are applied to 3D models to enhance visuals details.
- Numpy: Numpy is used to handle mathematical operations related to matrix transformations.
